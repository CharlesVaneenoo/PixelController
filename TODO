Roadmap PixelController
-----------------------
-Do not freeze application if output fails (disconnect serial controller)
-Particle generator (rain,snow,fireworks...) remember: maybe rip from cocos2d particle system, should replace fire and metaballs
-More layouts (Half/Half, 3/1...). Current layouts are hardware dependent. New layout shouldn't be. 
   +---+---+---+
   | a | b | c |
   +---+---+---+   
   | d | e | f |
   +---+---+---+   
 Example: 3/1 Layout defines 2 virtual panels, panel 1 using physical panel a,b,d,e panel 2 using physical panel c and f.
 Example: Fancy Layout defines 3 virtual panels, panel 1 using physical panel a,b,d,e, panel 2 using physical panel c
          panel 3 using physical panel f
-Unit Testing is suboptimal, use Mockito (or similar)
-Support Renard Protocol
-Option to invert GUI colors
-More GUI improvements (scaling, bigger fonts, save window position, option to bring both windows to front)
-Option to modify colorsets of all visuals
-implement colorlib Procesing lib (http://code.google.com/p/colorlib/)
-Add Perlin Noise generator
-Run headless (Use case: PixelController runns on a remote computer and PixelController is controlled via OSC)
 see https://sites.google.com/site/stamb2012/examples/batch-processing
-add more fader (pixel fader for example)
-support more than 2 rows
-Option to save output of PixelController (byte stream) to a flat file (Offline usage)
-Option to use system audio as input source, currently its only mic input. 
-Syphon support https://code.google.com/p/syphon-implementations/
-OLA (http://www.opendmx.net/index.php/Open_Lighting_Architecture) input plugin see https://github.com/neophob/ola-to-tpm2net
-Use Observer Pattern to update GUI elements
-Game of life generator
-Matrix device specific settings (bpp, cabling, mapping etc) should be inside the MatrixData class.
-Merge code of the output package, alot of duplicate code 


Roadmap PixelInvaders Firmware
------------------------------
-support Teensy 3 (PixelInvaders firmware, partly done)
-Support ambient color for the output panel(s)


Rejected roadmap features
-------------------------
-UDP output: support multiple output devices (probably not, alternative: use tpm2.net)
-Use Mozilla Rhino to create dynamic generators/effects
 -> using JDK1.6 Rhino is just too slow and cpu intensive (it needs about 40% cpu power with one Rhino js generator). 
    v8 (java8) should a an alternative, however v8 is OS dependent.
